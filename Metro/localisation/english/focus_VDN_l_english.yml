 VDN_industrial_effort:0 "Industrial Effort"
 VDN_industrial_effort_desc:0 "In the past, civil workshops were planned haphazardly and build with sub-par materials. With a little organizational effort, we can streamline and standardize the process for constructing such workshops."
 VDN_industrial_effort_2:0 "Civilian Effort"
 VDN_industrial_effort_2_desc:0 "Recent demands in construction and consumer needs mean that even more resources must go toward civil workshops. Walls can be knocked down, and rooms dug out to ensure there is enough room for more equipment, the only issue now is staffing all of it."
 VDN_industrial_effort_3:0 "Hire more Workers"
 VDN_industrial_effort_3_desc:0 "The need for manpower exists not only on the battlefield, but on the homefront too. Lucrative pay and benefits will lure private workers into our civilian factories, meaning they'll contribute towards the devices of the state."
 VDN_clear_the_debris:0 "Clear the Debris"
 VDN_clear_the_debris_desc:0 "There is a large amount of walkable infrastructure left inside our part of the metro; while it is mostly undamaged by the war, much of it is still unusable due to left over debris. Assigning work crews to clear out this junk will make it a lot easier for people to get between our station and Alexeyevskaya."
 VDN_expand_the_weapons_district:0 "Expand the Weapons District"
 VDN_expand_the_weapons_district_desc:0 "The Weapons district of Exhibition is where most of our makeshift firearms, bullets, and grenades are constructed. If we knock down a few walls and dig out some rooms, we'll be able to expand it with a few more workshops, though we don't have enough specialists to use them all."
 VDN_hire_more_gunsmiths:0 "Hire more Gunsmiths"
 VDN_hire_more_gunsmiths_desc:0 "With new workshops mostly sitting empty due to lack of talent, the community has seen fit to offer lucrative pay to any weaponsmiths looking for somewhere to settle. Most of it will end up back in the local shops anyway, so not much is lost."


 #historical-ish
 VDN_a_peaceful_trader:0 "Peaceful Trader"
 VDN_a_peaceful_trader_desc:0 "Metro Geopolitics is not for us. Delusions of grand empire or communist revolution are simply untenable for a station as small as ours. Our best bet for securing our place in the metro is strength through cooperation, and trade."
 VDN_increase_trade_with_our_neighbours:0 "Increase Trade with our Neighbors"
 VDN_increase_trade_with_our_neighbours_desc:0 "Our oldest friends and most accessible trading partners are the stations of Riga and Alekseyevskaya. Though small foot trade is common, building dedicated rail lines between us and them would only strengthen our bond and prosperity."
 VDN_economic_relationship:0 "Economic Cooperation"
 VDN_economic_relationship_desc:0 "Now that the infrastructure is in place for the regular movement of materials, we can begin to close some of the gaps in eachother's economies, resulting in greater output overall."
 VDN_political_relationship:0 "Political  Relationship"
 VDN_political_relationship_desc:0 "ow that the infrastructure is in place for the regular movement of mail and missives, we can cooperate politically, helping to keep down on emergent issues like unrest and plague."
 VDN_the_commonwealth:0 "The Commonwealth"
 VDN_the_commonwealth_desc:0 "Good relations mixed with recent cooperation treaties have brought about talks of uniting the stations into a formal commonwealth together. It seems our generosity and friendliness have paid off, as we stand to be the dominant member in such a group."
 VDN_encourage_closer_friendship:0 "Encourage Closer Friendship"
 VDN_encourage_closer_friendship_desc:0 "The environment created by such close cooperation has lead to genuine friendship between our stations. Some people go so far as to say the borders between them no longer exist, finding closer camaraderie in eachother than any other outsiders."

 VDN_reinforce_the_northern_tunnel:0 "Reinforce the Northern Tunnel"
 VDN_reinforce_the_northern_tunnel_desc:0 ""Si vis pacem, para bellum." It's an old latin proverb that means "If you want peace, prepare for war." Our situation with the mutants and claims of dark creatures to the north has not yet escalated to a full war...but it would be unwise to not take preventative measures."

 VDN_slow_rearmament:0 "Slow Rearmament"
 VDN_slow_rearmament_desc:0 "Raising up a militia from three different stations is tough on it's on, but a proper army is even harder. Rearmament will come slowly, and will work only at a pace the people find comfortable."

 VDN_approach_the_path_of_fascism_desc:0 "Strength is the only thing that matters in the metro, nothing else trumps it. If Exhibition is to survive, it will do so by strength of will, or it will not survive at all! Plans have been drawn to completely remake the governance of Exhibition into something new, something powerful!"

 VDN_convince_sukhoi_desc:0 "Sukhoi is not an unreasonable man, but he is resistant to our ideals. A few meetings, some bribes, promises we may not actually be able to keep, and other grease in the cogs ought to turn him into the Fuhrer we've been looking for!"
 VDN_get_rid_of_him:0 "Assassinate Sukhoi"
 VDN_get_rid_of_him_desc:0 "Sukhoi is far too much of a reliability to our movement. He is a popular man of the people, with a large amount of reservations against our vision of a future Exhibition. He has to go, and it must be done at any cost."

 VDN_expand_into_alekseyevskaya_desc:0 "Our most immediate neighbors to the south are weak. They amount to nothing more than poor mushroom farmers constantly beset by disease and misfortune. Occupation of Alekseyevskaya should be no worse than a walk in the park."
 VDN_expand_into_rizhkaya:0 "Expand into Rizhkaya"
 VDN_expand_into_rizhkaya_desc:0 "Riga is the stronger of the two commonwealth members, and should not be underestimated. Their strength is finite however, and being pressed against the hawkish Hanza means they have nowhere to turn when we arrive."
 VDN_occupy_prospekt_mira_north:0 "Occupy Prospekt Mira North"
 VDN_occupy_prospekt_mira_north_desc:0 "The Hanzans are a decadent, lazy group. Their focus is entirely on stockpiling a dragon's hoard of bullets, and not on smaller stations like ourselves. This is advantageous to us, a small guard regiment is all that stands between us and the occupation of northern Mira."
 VDN_deport_outsiders_alekseyevskaya:0 "Deport Outsiders"
 VDN_deport_outsiders_alekseyevskaya_desc:0 "Mutants, Communists, and Agitators have no place in our society. They will be made to leave their putrid dens, and all that remains will be our loyal followers."
