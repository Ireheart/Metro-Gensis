 #industrial path
 VDN_clear_the_debris:0 "Clear the Debris"
 VDN_clear_the_debris_desc:0 "Walk-ability in the metro is quite important, as it is the main way materials, manpower, and equipment is moved from place to place besides railcarts; much of the metro's walkable area is still intact, only made inaccessible by debris! With a few demolition and digging teams, we could uncover many of the pathways of the past. "
 VDN_educate_the_people:0 "Educate the People"
 VDN_educate_the_people_desc:0 "The brain is that which sets humankind apart from the beasts of this world. It's labor is thought, and like any labored part of the body, it must be exercised and enriched. The opening of proper schools in every station will give the average person a place to expand their mind."
 VDN_metros_library:0 "Metro's Library"
 VDN_metros_library_desc:0 "Knowledge is a fleeting thing, with most people primarily concerned with survival, there are very few scholars left penning new literature. That means that we have something of an obligation to collect any books we can get our hands on. Fiction, non-fiction, technical documentation, even old propaganda. It all must be archived so it can be studied, the building suitable for this is the newly christened Exhibition library, the largest in the metro!"
 VDN_hire_more_scientists:0 "Hire more Scientists"
 VDN_hire_more_scientists_desc:0 "Exhibition has begun to experience something of a scientific Renaissance recently; more educated people who have better access to knowledge means that scientific experimentation has become a popular hobby for a few! Taking these gifted individuals onto a proper payroll means that their knack for discovery can be used by the VDNKh!"
 VDN_industrial_effort:0 "Industrial Effort"
 VDN_industrial_effort_desc:0 "In the past, civil workshops were planned haphazardly and built with sub-par materials. With a little organizational effort, we can streamline and standardize the process for constructing such workshops."
 VDN_industrial_effort_2:0 "Civilian Effort"
 VDN_industrial_effort_2_desc:0 "Recent demands in construction and consumer needs mean that even more resources must go toward civil workshops. Walls can be knocked down, and rooms dug out to ensure there is enough room for more equipment, the only issue now is staffing all of it."
 VDN_industrial_effort_3:0 "Hire more Workers"
 VDN_industrial_effort_3_desc:0 "The need for manpower exists not only on the battlefield, but on the homefront too. Lucrative pay and benefits will lure private workers into our civilian factories, meaning they'll contribute towards the devices of the state."
 VDN_clear_the_debris:0 "Clear the Debris"
 VDN_clear_the_debris_desc:0 "There is a large amount of walkable infrastructure left inside our part of the metro; while it is mostly undamaged by the war, much of it is still unusable due to left over debris. Assigning work crews to clear out this junk will make it a lot easier for people to get between our station and Alexeyevskaya."
 VDN_expand_the_weapons_district:0 "Expand the Weapons District"
 VDN_expand_the_weapons_district_desc:0 "The Weapons district of Exhibition is where most of our makeshift firearms, bullets, and grenades are constructed. If we knock down a few walls and dig out some rooms, we'll be able to expand it with a few more workshops, though we don't have enough specialists to use them all."
 VDN_hire_more_gunsmiths:0 "Hire more Gunsmiths"
 VDN_hire_more_gunsmiths_desc:0 "With new workshops mostly sitting empty due to lack of talent, the community has seen fit to offer lucrative pay to any weaponsmiths looking for somewhere to settle. Most of it will end up back in the local shops anyway, so not much is lost."


 #historical-ish
 VDN_a_peaceful_trader:0 "Peaceful Trader"
 VDN_a_peaceful_trader_desc:0 "Metro Geopolitics is not for us. Delusions of grand empire or communist revolution are simply untenable for a station as small as ours. Our best bet for securing our place in the metro is strength through cooperation, and trade."
 VDN_increase_trade_with_our_neighbours:0 "Increase Trade with our Neighbors"
 VDN_increase_trade_with_our_neighbours_desc:0 "Our oldest friends and most accessible trading partners are the stations of Riga and Alekseyevskaya. Though small foot trade is common, building dedicated rail lines between us and them would only strengthen our bond and prosperity."
 VDN_economic_relationship:0 "Economic Cooperation"
 VDN_economic_relationship_desc:0 "Now that the infrastructure is in place for the regular movement of materials, we can begin to close some of the gaps in eachother's economies, resulting in greater output overall."
 VDN_political_relationship:0 "Political  Relationship"
 VDN_political_relationship_desc:0 "ow that the infrastructure is in place for the regular movement of mail and missives, we can cooperate politically, helping to keep down on emergent issues like unrest and plague."
 VDN_the_commonwealth:0 "The Commonwealth"
 VDN_the_commonwealth_desc:0 "Good relations mixed with recent cooperation treaties have brought about talks of uniting the stations into a formal commonwealth together. It seems our generosity and friendliness have paid off, as we stand to be the dominant member in such a group."
 VDN_encourage_closer_friendship:0 "Encourage Closer Friendship"
 VDN_encourage_closer_friendship_desc:0 "The environment created by such close cooperation has lead to genuine friendship between our stations. Some people go so far as to say the borders between them no longer exist, finding closer camaraderie in eachother than any other outsiders."
 VDN_no_longer_friends:0 "We are no longer Friends, we are Brothers!"

  #a sudden threat
 VDN_reinforce_the_northern_tunnel:0 "Reinforce the Northern Tunnel"
 VDN_reinforce_the_northern_tunnel_desc:0 ""Si vis pacem, para bellum." It's an old latin proverb that means "If you want peace, prepare for war." Our situation with the mutants and claims of dark creatures to the north has not yet escalated to a full war...but it would be unwise to not take preventative measures."

 VDN_approach_the_path_of_fascism_desc:0 "Strength is the only thing that matters in the metro, nothing else trumps it. If Exhibition is to survive, it will do so by strength of will, or it will not survive at all! Plans have been drawn to completely remake the governance of Exhibition into something new, something powerful!"

 VDN_convince_sukhoi_desc:0 "Sukhoi is not an unreasonable man, but he is resistant to our ideals. A few meetings, some bribes, promises we may not actually be able to keep, and other grease in the cogs ought to turn him into the Fuhrer we've been looking for!"
 VDN_get_rid_of_him:0 "Assassinate Sukhoi"
 VDN_get_rid_of_him_desc:0 "Sukhoi is far too much of a reliability to our movement. He is a popular man of the people, with a large amount of reservations against our vision of a future Exhibition. He has to go, and it must be done at any cost."
 VDN_befriend_the_reich:0 "Befriend the Reich"
 VDN_befriend_the_reich_desc:0 "In this wretched world of mutants, communists, and various nedochelovek there is only one other nation that truly understands the strength of will required to seize glory from the carcass of the old world: The Fourth Reich. Their strength makes them a naturally mistrusted people by the rest of the Metro, so it would be far easier to court them as an ally, especially once they see we now share their beliefs!"

 VDN_expand_into_rizhkaya:0 "Expand into Rizhkaya"
 VDN_expand_into_rizhkaya_desc:0 "Riga is the stronger of the two commonwealth members, and should not be underestimated. Their strength is finite however, and being pressed against the hawkish Hanza means they have nowhere to turn when we arrive."
 VDN_occupy_prospekt_mira_north:0 "Occupy Prospekt Mira North"
 VDN_occupy_prospekt_mira_north_desc:0 "The Hanzans are a decadent, lazy group. Their focus is entirely on stockpiling a dragon's hoard of bullets, and not on smaller stations like ourselves. This is advantageous to us, a small guard regiment is all that stands between us and the occupation of northern Mira."

 VDN_we_stand_alone:0 "We Stand Alone"
 VDN_we_stand_alone_desc:0 "Our courtship of the Reich has not borne enough fruit, even now as the bright flame of fascism is threatened, they will not support our annexation of Northen Prospekt Mira. This is a battle we will have to fight on our own."
 VDN_total_mobilization:0 "Total Mobilization"
 VDN_total_mobilization_desc:0 "In times of great crisis, we cannot allow our industrial might to be tied up in petty civilian luxuries like fine clothes, toys, and goods.

 VDN_death_or_dishonour:0 "Death or Dishonour"
 VDN_death_or_dishonour_desc:0 "In times of peace, the pure people of our commonwealth can trifle themselves with civilian jobs, but in times of war, they must be called to the front to fight. Some may say that we have somehow brought this upon ourselves, but they simply do not understand that we have always been in a state of war with the rest of the Metro, and that it was always destined to end in either their destruction, or ours!"

 VDN_damage_hanza_supply_desc:0 "The Hanza supply network is a complex thing that spans the length of the entire ring, and it is the backbone of their military. But without it, how can they compete? Soldiers cannot fight with empty rifles, empty stomachs, empty canteens! A group of volunteers has been given armor, rifles, and enough explosives to collapse tunnels all along Prospekt Mira. Even if they succeed they will not make it back."
