## Veles Path

#### We were banished to the underworld. We must hide from the Veles wrath, this struggle is the price we must pay for trusting false idols. [Veles tries to finish what Perun has started...]


> Path of Veles is ultimately an isolationist path which will lead to the great sacrifice of the people. [There will be oposition towards accepting the isolation fate [dropping stability] regular sacrificing and cleansing will be required, if stability drops enough a civil war with reformed pagans is possible]
> [escapee event that will trigger hostility towards the station]



## Perun Path

#### For our sins we were banished to the underwold. However Perun is a mercifull god. Humanity needs to understand that the only way up is to forget about the false idols and acceept Perun teachings! We will not rest till our mission is complete!

> Path of Perun will ultimately lead towards reformed paganism while avoiding civil war [banishing Veles believers] 
> Reformed pagans will be rather offensive country gaining boosts [war justification time, manpower, attack]
